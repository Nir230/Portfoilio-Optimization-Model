# Portfoilio-Optimization-Model
This project is geared towards developing a Linear Programming (LP) model that will assist with portfolio management.
The aim is to achieve maximum returns on investment with reasonable risk and other constraints such as risk appetite, diversification, and amount of money available.
This kind of policy mirrors J.P. Morgan's approach to managing investments with a view to minimizing operational risk and maximizing ROI.
